            Navagrahas fall under the the Hindu Astronomy and play a major part in the Hindu astronomical sphere. The Hindu astronomy whose origin dates back to the time of Vedas is concerned with the placement of nine planets and their influence on the world and on an individual. According to the Hindu astrology, the position of the planets when a person is born determines his potential in life.
        </p>

        <p>
            The nine planets collectively are called Navagrahas. These 9 planets are worshipped by Hindus to overcome any hindrance, obstacle or bad luck. They are found mostly in all the temples and faithful believers pray to the Navagrahas before they pray to any other deity.
        </p>
        <p>
            Out of those nine planets, seven are named after the planets in the Solar System and the other two are actually demons who managed their way into this group by trickery – Rahu and Ketu. Depending upon their location in the planetary system, they are deemed either auspicious or inauspicious. While Navagrahas are found in every temple, there are some temples that are solely dedicated to them. One such temple is the Navagraha temple located in the outskirts of Ujjain.

        <h3>
            Effects of Navagrahas – Vedic Astrology
        </h3>

        <p>
            In Hindu Astrology, Navagrahas affects a person’s happiness, success and all-round prosperity. The good and bad, positive and negative influences of each of these nine planets are results of factors like the specific location of the planets on the birth chart, etc. Planets possessing Sattva nature are Jupiter, Sun and Moon. Planets bearing rajas are Venus and Mercury while planets with Tamas nature are Mars, Saturn, Rahu and Ketu.
        </p>

        <p>
            These nine planets in vedic astrology are treated as deities with specific powers, nature and characteristic qualities depending on what each of these offers – positive or negative to people.
